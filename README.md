# SMOKE-DETECTION-IOT

The project focuses on the IOT based smoke alarm detection system which alarms the users about the increase in the level of smoke at a particular place and acts as a security management system. The use of MQT gas sensor and ESP8266 wifi module helps the system note the value of the smoke present in the room and using the ESP8266 wifi module the data is transferred to Thing Speak where the data is plotted in the graph. The ThingSpeak on reaching the maximum limit calls the Twilio API and sends the message to the administrator to warn them about the estimated value of gas inside the room.
